<h1>Common questions and issues</h1>

<h4>PBNify isn't running at all.</h4>

<p>
  If you try selecting a palette and clicking "PBNify" and it doesn't
  start computing, then there could be a compatibility issue with your
  device or browser.  Try running it from a different computer.
</p>

<h4>It's stuck on "identifying color regions..."</h4>

<p>
  Usually it finishes within a minute, but it could take longer
  depending on the computer speed, having a lot of colors chosen for
  the palette, or having a very tall image.  Hopefully changing one or
  more of those will get it to finish.
</p>

<h4>Is there an installable version / Can I run PBNify offline?</h4>

<p>
  I do not have an installable version since it's written in web
  languages and would require substantial rewriting.  However, since
  everything happens locally in the browser, you could in theory run
  PBNify offline.  You'd have to
  download <a href="https://github.com/daniel-munro/pbnify">the
  repository</a>, replace CDN references to local libraries, and run a
  local web server to serve PBNify from that directory.
</p>

<h4>How do I get better resolution in the outline?</h4>

<!-- <p> -->
<!--   PBNify always resizes the input and output images to a width of 800 -->
<!--   pixels.  However, if the image is wider than it is tall, you could -->
<!--   rotate it beforehand.  Then, the smaller dimension will be set to -->
<!--   800px, and would allow for more detail. -->
	<!-- </p> -->
<p>
  You can use the slider to set the width before loading an image, and
  a higher number results in a more detailed outline.
</p>

<h4>What does all this color info mean and how do I use it to buy
  paints?</h4>

<p>
  Those are different ways of specifying a color as used with
  computers and printers.  The hex code (e.g. #386e97) and RGB give
  red/green/blue components, HSL gives hue/saturation/lightness,
  HSV/HSB gives hue/saturation/value(brightness), and CMYK gives
  cyan/magenta/yellow/black, which is used for printers.  I included
  all of them in case they are helpful in obtaining paints for the
  palette colors, but I'm not sure which ones are actually used for
  that, if any.  When I've done PBNs I've only mixed basic paints to
  approximate the colors.  If you find out what color specifications
  are used to buy custom paint colors, let me know and I'll add it!
</p>

<h4>How do I print the outline onto canvas?</h4>

<p>
  I haven't tried printing onto anything except regular paper, so I'm
  not sure how to do it.  If you find a way, let me know and I'll put
  it here.
</p>

<h4>Can I get the outline as vector graphics?</h4>

<p>
  PBNify cannot provide a vector graphic because its algorithms are
  based on a pixel grid and directly create a raster image.
</p>

<h4>I don't know how to save/print the results.</h4>

<p>
  This step can vary because different devices and browsers handle it
  differently.  One option is to "print to PDF" from the print page,
  which saves it as a PDF file.  Otherwise, you should be able to
  close the print box, right-click on the image and save it.  As a
  last resort you can screenshot and crop.  You can do that from the
  main page if the tab that opens is blank.
</p>

<h4>I'd like to use PBNify's code for my project/business.</h4>

<p>
  You are welcome to use, copy, and modify the code, including for
  commercial purposes.  I don't have time to help with business
  ventures, but I'd love to see what you do with it.
</p>
<p>
  You may also use the PBNify output you create for commercial
  purposes, such as in a coloring book, as long as you aren't
  infringing copyright on the source images.
